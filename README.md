During the late winter of 1971, Shamberg went to Nassau in the Bahamas and wrote a book. As a result of his experiences publishing Radical Software and, most particularly, his association with Gillette, Paul Ryan, Schneider, Korot and others in the Raindance affinity group, Shamberg decided to attempt to put the message of Radical Software into book form. It would, he thought, bring Raindance, and Radical Software, to a wider audience, and offer a more permanent repository for the Raindance idea than the disposable issues of the magazine. At the same time, it might bring in some much needed revenue. A history of successful alternative publishing was taking shape, sparked by Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog.

Distilling the 'raps' of Gillette and others, and writings of Paul Ryan about the aggressive use of video in the social ferment of the early 70s, Shamberg retailed them in popular book form. Guerrilla Television, published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston, appeared in the bookstores in November, 1971.

 

Guerrilla Television outlined an alternate media philosophy and practicum, an instructional text with essays, illustrations, and practical advice written in language appropriate to young activists. Although the exact distribution figures are not known, it may have sold 25,000 copies, perhaps more.

Designed by Ant Farm, a west coast video and design group that Shamberg had contact with through his college friend, Allen Rucker, Guerrilla Television was divided into two sections: 'Meta Manual', which consisted of a distillation of the ideas of his associates transmogrified by Shamberg, and 'Manual', which contained more practical information. Executed with wit and a lively graphic style, it was a Radical Software in book form and was meant to be so. It was designated Vol. I, Number 6 of Radical Software, although it appeared on the street before Number 5.
